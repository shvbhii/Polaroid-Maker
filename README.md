This project is **Day 1** of the **#30DaysOfVibeCoding** challenge, a daily exploration into building and shipping web projects with a creative, AI-assisted workflow.

The Polaroid Photo Frame Maker is a fun, interactive tool built with React that lets you upload a photo, wrap it in a classic Polaroid frame, add a handwritten caption, and decorate it with draggable stickers.

## 🚀 The "Vibe Coding" Angle

This project was built following the **Vibe Coding** philosophy, where AI tools are used as creative collaborators rather than just code utilities.

For this project, AI assistance played a key role in:
*   **Component Refactoring:** Suggesting how to break down the monolithic `App.jsx` into smaller, reusable components like `ControlsPanel`, `Workspace`, and `Footer`.
*   **CSS Brainstorming:** Generating ideas for the "glassmorphism" UI panel and the hover animations, helping to quickly shape the visual feel.
*   **Code Snippets:** Providing the boilerplate for complex tasks like using the `html-to-image` library and setting up the `react-rnd` draggable components.


---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

*   **Framework:** React + Vite
*   **Styling:** CSS3 with custom properties and pseudo-elements
*   **Icons:** `react-icons`
*   **Draggable Elements:** `react-rnd`
*   **Image Conversion:** `html-to-image`
